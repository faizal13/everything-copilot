# Continuous Learning Skill

## Name
Continuous Learning

## Description
Pattern extraction from real work sessions — identifying reusable patterns, storing them as instincts with confidence scores, and converting ad-hoc solutions into formal reusable knowledge.

## Trigger Conditions
- End of a significant work session
- After solving a novel or difficult problem
- When a pattern is used repeatedly
- After a debugging breakthrough
- On `/learn` or `/instinct-status` commands

## Files
- `pattern-extraction.md` — How to identify and document reusable patterns
- `instinct-storage.md` — Instinct format, confidence scoring, storage
- `reusable-patterns.md` — Converting instincts into formal reusable patterns

## Model Recommendation
- **Sonnet** for pattern analysis and extraction
- **Haiku** for quick instinct logging and status checks
