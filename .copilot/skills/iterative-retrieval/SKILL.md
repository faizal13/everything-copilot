# Iterative Retrieval Skill

## Name
Iterative Retrieval

## Description
Progressive context refinement strategies for efficiently gathering information from large codebases. Covers search narrowing, subagent orchestration, and multi-turn context management.

## Trigger Conditions
- Exploring a large or unfamiliar codebase
- Multi-file search across many directories
- Building context for complex tasks
- When initial search returns too many or too few results

## Files
- `context-refinement.md` — Progressive narrowing from broad to specific
- `subagent-orchestration.md` — Multi-agent coordination for parallel retrieval
- `progressive-narrowing.md` — Search strategies and relevance scoring

## Model Recommendation
- **Sonnet** for orchestration and context analysis
- **Haiku** for rapid search iterations
