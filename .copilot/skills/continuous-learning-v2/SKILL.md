# Continuous Learning V2 Skill

## Name
Continuous Learning V2

## Description
Advanced pattern management: confidence scoring with decay, clustering related instincts, and automatically evolving mature clusters into formal skills.

## Trigger Conditions
- Managing instinct confidence scores
- Clustering or organizing learned patterns
- Evolving instincts into formal skills
- On `/evolve`, `/instinct-status` commands

## Files
- `instinct-confidence.md` — Confidence scoring, decay, calibration
- `instinct-clustering.md` — Grouping related patterns by similarity
- `evolve-to-skills.md` — Promoting clusters into formal skill files

## Model Recommendation
- **Sonnet** for clustering and evolution analysis
- **Haiku** for confidence scoring updates
