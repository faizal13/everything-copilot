# Test-Driven Development Skill

## Name
Test-Driven Development

## Description
TDD methodology, test patterns, and coverage validation for building reliable software through the RED → GREEN → REFACTOR cycle.

## Trigger Conditions
- Writing tests or implementing features with TDD
- Test coverage analysis or improvement
- Test framework configuration (Jest, pytest, go test)
- Debugging failing tests
- Files matching: `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, `*_test.go`, `test_*.py`, `conftest.py`

## Files
- `tdd-workflow.md` — RED → GREEN → REFACTOR cycle, when to use TDD, anti-patterns
- `jest-patterns.md` — Jest setup, mocking, async testing, snapshots
- `pytest-patterns.md` — Fixtures, parametrize, markers, conftest patterns
- `coverage-validation.md` — Coverage targets, branch coverage, mutation testing

## Model Recommendation
- **Sonnet** for test generation and TDD workflow
- **Haiku** for quick test scaffolding and fixture generation
